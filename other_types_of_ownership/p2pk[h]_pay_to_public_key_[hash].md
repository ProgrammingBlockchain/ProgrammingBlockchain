## P2PK[H] \(Pay to Public Key [Hash]\) {#p2pk-h-pay-to-public-key-hash}

### P2PKH - Quick recap
We learned that a **Bitcoin address** is generated by a **public key hash** and a **network identifier**.  

```cs
var publicKeyHash = new Key().PubKey.Hash;
var bitcoinAddress = publicKeyHash.GetAddress(Network.Main);
Console.WriteLine(publicKeyHash); 
//Output
//41e0d7ab8af1ba5452b824116a31357dc931cf28
Console.WriteLine(bitcoinAddress); 
//Output
//171LGoEKyVzgQstGwnTHVh3TFTgo5PsqiY
```  

We also learned that as far as the blockchain is concerned, there is no such thing as a **bitcoin address**. The Blockchain identifies a receiver by a **ScriptPubKey**. And such **ScriptPubKey** could be generated from a Bitcoin address.  

```cs
var scriptPubKey = bitcoinAddress.ScriptPubKey;
Console.WriteLine(scriptPubKey);
//Output
//OP_DUP OP_HASH160 41e0d7ab8af1ba5452b824116a31357dc931cf28 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
```  

And vice versa. a Bitcoin address could be generated from a ScriptPubKey, but along with a network identifier.  

```cs
var sameBitcoinAddress = scriptPubKey.GetDestinationAddress(Network.Main);
```

### P2PK

However, not all **ScriptPubKey** represents a Bitcoin address. For example, the ScriptPubKey in the first transaction in the first ever blockchain block called the genesis block doesn't represent a Bitcoin address. In other words, the first ScriptPubKey ever in the genesis block represents null as a Bitcoin address.  

```cs
Block genesisBlock = Network.Main.GetGenesis();
Transaction firstTransactionEver = genesisBlock.Transactions.First();
var firstOutputEver = firstTransactionEver.Outputs.First();
var firstScriptPubKeyEver = firstOutputEver.ScriptPubKey;
var firstBitcoinAddressEver = firstScriptPubKeyEver.GetDestinationAddress(Network.Main);
Console.WriteLine(firstBitcoinAddressEver == null); 
//Output
//True
```  

```cs
Console.WriteLine(firstTransactionEver);
```  

```json
{
â€¦
  "out": [
    {
      "value": "50.00000000",
      "scriptPubKey": "04678afdb0fe5548271967f1a67130b7105cd6a828e03909a67962e0ea1f61deb649f6bc3f4cef38c4f35504e51ec112de5c384df7ba0b8d578a4c702b6bf11d5f OP_CHECKSIG"
    }
  ]
}
```  

You can see that the form of the **ScriptPubKey** is different:  

```cs
Console.WriteLine(firstScriptPubKeyEver); 
//Output
//04678afdb0fe5548271967f1a67130b7105cd6a828e03909a67962e0ea1f61deb649f6bc3f4cef38c4f35504e51ec112de5c384df7ba0b8d578a4c702b6bf11d5f OP_CHECKSIG
```

A Bitcoin address is represented by:  
**OP_DUP OP_HASH160 &lt;hash&gt; OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG**

But here we have:  
**&lt;pubkey&gt; OP_CHECKSIG**

In fact, it's because, at the beginning, **public key**s were used directly in the **ScriptPubKey**. 

```cs
var firstPubKeyEver = firstScriptPubKeyEver.GetDestinationPublicKeys().First();
Console.WriteLine(firstPubKeyEver); 
//Output: //04678afdb0fe5548271967f1a67130b7105cd6a828e03909a67962e0ea1f61deb649f6bc3f4cef38c4f35504e51ec112de5c384df7ba0b8d578a4c702b6bf11d5f
```

Now we are mainly using the hash of the public key.  
Examine how each P2PK and P2PKH works with a private key, a public key, a public key hash, and a ScriptPubKey.  

![](../assets/PPKH.png)  

```cs
key = new Key();
Console.WriteLine("Pay to public key : " + key.PubKey.ScriptPubKey);
Console.WriteLine();
Console.WriteLine("Pay to public key hash : " + key.PubKey.Hash.ScriptPubKey);
```  

``` 
Pay to public key : 02fb8021bc7dedcc2f89a67e75cee81fedb8e41d6bfa6769362132544dfdf072d4 OP_CHECKSIG
Pay to public key hash : OP_DUP OP_HASH160 0ae54d4cec828b722d8727cb70f4a6b0a88207b2 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
```  

These 2 types of payment are referred as **P2PK** (Pay To Public Key) and **P2PKH** (Pay To Public Key Hash).

Satoshi later decided to use P2PKH instead of P2PK for two reasons:

*   Elliptic Curve Cryptography, the cryptography used by your **public key** and **private key**, is vulnerable to a modified Shor's algorithm for solving the discrete logarithm problem on elliptic curves. In plain English, it means that in the future a quantum computer might be able to **retrieve a private key from a public key**. By publishing the public key only when the coins are spent (and assuming that addresses are not reused), such an attack is rendered ineffective. 
*   With the hash being smaller (20 bytes) it is easier to print and easier to embed into small storage mediums like QR codes.

Nowadays, there is no reason to use a P2PK directly although it is still used in combination with a P2SH... And more on this later.  

> ([Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4isxjr/petition_to_protect_satoshis_coins/d30we6f)) If the issue of the early use of P2PK is not addressed, it will have a serious impact on the Bitcoin price.  

### Exercise
([nopara73](https://github.com/nopara73)) While reading this chapter I found the abbreviations (P2PK, P2PKH, P2W*, etc..) very confusing.  
My trick was to force myself to pronounce the terms fully every time I encountered them during the following lessons. Suddenly everything made much more sense. I recommend you to do the same.
