# Generate Key dan Enkripsi {#key-generation-encryption}

## Apakah _random_ saja sudah cukup? {#is-it-random-enough}

When you call **new Key\(\)**, under the hood, you are using a PRNG \(Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator\) to generate your private key. On windows, it uses the **RNGCryptoServiceProvider**, a .NET wrapper around the Windows Crypto API.

On Android, I use the **SecureRandom**, and in fact, you can use your own implementation with **RandomUtils.Random**.

On IOS, I have not implemented it and you need to create your **IRandom** implementation.

For a computer, being random is hard. But the biggest issue is that it is impossible to know if a serie of number is really random.

If a malware modifies your PRNG \(and so, can predict the numbers you will generate\), you won’t see it until it is too late.

It means that a cross platform and naïve implementation of PRNG \(like using computer’s clock combined with CPU speed\) is dangerous. But you won’t see it until it is too late.

For performance reason, most PRNG works the same way: a random number, called **Seed**, is chosen, then a predictable formula generates the next numbers each time you ask for it.

The amount of randomness of the seed is defined by a measure we call **Entropy**, but the amount of **Entropy** also depends on the observer.

Let’s say you generate a seed from your clock time.  
And let’s imagine that your clock has 1ms of resolution. \(Reality is more ~15ms\)

If your attacker knows that you generated the key last week, then your seed has  
1000 \* 60 \* 60 \* 24 \* 7 = 604800000 possibilities.

For such attacker, the entropy is LOG\(604800000;2\) = 29.17 bits.

And enumerating such number on my home computer took less than 2 seconds…We call such enumeration “brute forcing”.

However let’s say, you use the clock time + the process id for generating the seed.  
Let’s imagine that there are 1024 different process ids.

So now, the attacker needs to enumerate 604800000 \* 1024 possibilities, which take around 2000 seconds.  
Now, let’s add the time when I turned on my computer, assuming the attacker knows I turned it on today, it adds 86400000 possibilities.

Now the attacker needs to enumerate 604800000 \* 1024 \* 86400000 = 5,35088E+19 possibilities.  
However, keep in mind that if the attacker infiltrate my computer, he can get this last piece of info, and bring down the number of possibilities, reducing entropy.

Entropy is measured by **LOG\(possibilities;2\)** and so LOG\(5,35088E+19; 2\) = 65 bits.

Is it enough? Probably. Assuming your attacker does not know more information about the realm of possibilities.

But since the hash of a public key is 20 bytes = 160 bits, it is smaller than the total universe of the addresses. You might do better.

> **Note:** Adding entropy is linearly harder, cracking entropy is exponentially harder

An interesting way of generating entropy quickly is by asking human intervention. \(Moving the mouse.\)

If you don’t trust completely the platform PRNG \(which is [not so paranoic](http://android-developers.blogspot.fr/2013/08/some-securerandom-thoughts.html)\), you can add entropy to the PRNG output that NBitcoin is using.

```cs
RandomUtils.AddEntropy("hello");
RandomUtils.AddEntropy(new byte[] { 1, 2, 3 });
var nsaProofKey = new Key();
```

What NBitcoin does when you call **AddEntropy\(data\)** is:  
**additionalEntropy = SHA\(SHA\(data\) ^ additionalEntropy\)**

Then when you generate a new number:  
**result = SHA\(PRNG\(\) ^ additionalEntropy\)**

## Key Derivation Function {#key-derivation-function}

However, the most important is not the number of possibilities. It is the time that an attacker would need to successfully break your key. That’s where KDF enters the game.

KDF, or **Key Derivation Function** is a way to have a stronger key, even if your entropy is low.

Imagine that you want to generate a seed, and the attacker knows that there are 10.000.000 possibilities.  
Such a seed would be normally cracked pretty easily.

But what if you could make the enumeration slower?  
A KDF is a hash function that waste computing resources on purpose.  
Here is an example:

```cs
var derived = SCrypt.BitcoinComputeDerivedKey("hello", new byte[] { 1, 2, 3 });
RandomUtils.AddEntropy(derived);
```

Even if your attacker knows that your source of entropy is 5 letters, he will need to run Scrypt to check a possibility, which take 5 seconds on my computer.

Bottom line of the story: There is nothing paranoid into distrusting a PRNG, you can mitigate an attack by both adding entropy and also using a KDF.  
Keep in mind that an attacker can decrease entropy by gathering information about you or your system.  
If you use the timestamp as entropy source, then he can decrease the entropy by knowing you generated the key last week, and that you only use your computer between 9am and 6pm.

In the previous part I talked quickly about a special KDF called **Scrypt.** As I said, the goal of a KDF is to make brute force costly.

So it should be no surprise for you that a standard already exists for encrypting your private key with a password using a KDF. This is [BIP38](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/775226/NBitcoin-Cryptography-Part).

![](../assets/EncryptedKey.png)

```cs
var privateKey = new Key();
var bitcoinPrivateKey = privateKey.GetWif(Network.Main);
Console.WriteLine(bitcoinPrivateKey); // L1tZPQt7HHj5V49YtYAMSbAmwN9zRjajgXQt9gGtXhNZbcwbZk2r
BitcoinEncryptedSecret encryptedBitcoinPrivateKey = bitcoinPrivateKey.Encrypt("password");
Console.WriteLine(encryptedBitcoinPrivateKey); // 6PYKYQQgx947Be41aHGypBhK6TA5Xhi9TdPBkatV3fHbbKrdDoBoXFCyLK
var decryptedBitcoinPrivateKey = encryptedBitcoinPrivateKey.GetSecret("password");
Console.WriteLine(decryptedBitcoinPrivateKey); // L1tZPQt7HHj5V49YtYAMSbAmwN9zRjajgXQt9gGtXhNZbcwbZk2r

Console.ReadLine();
```

Such encryption is used in two different cases:

* You don not trust your storage provider \(they can get hacked\)  
* You are storing the key on the behalf of somebody else \(and you do not want to know his key\)  

If you own your storage, then encrypting at the database level might be enough.

Be careful if your server takes care of decrypting the key, an attacker might attempt to DDOS your server by forcing it to decrypt lots of keys.

Delegate decryption to the ultimate user when you can.

## Like the good ol’ days {#like-the-good-ol-days}

First, why generating several keys?  
The main reason is privacy. Since you can see the balance of all addresses, it is better to use a new address for each transaction.

However, in practice, you can also generate keys for each contact. Because this make a simple way to identify your payer without leaking too much privacy.

You can generate key, like you did from the beginning:

```cs
var privateKey = new Key()
```

However, you have two problems with that:

* All backup of your wallet that you have will become outdated when you generate a new key.  
* You cannot delegate the address creation process to an untrusted peer.  

If you are developing a web wallet and generate key on behalf of your users, and one user get hacked, she will immediately start suspecting you.

## BIP38 \(Part 2\) {#bip38-part-2}

We already saw BIP38 for encrypting a key, however this BIP is in reality two ideas in one document.

The second part of the BIP, show how you can delegate Key and Address creation to an untrusted peer. It will fix one of our concern.

**The idea is to generate a PassphraseCode to the key generator. With this PassphraseCode, he will be able to generate encrypted keys on your behalf, without knowing your password, nor any private key. **

This **PassphraseCode** can be given to your key generator in WIF format.

> **Tip**: In NBitcoin, all types prefixed by “Bitcoin” are Base58 \(WIF\) data.

So, as a user that want to delegate key creation, first you will create the **PassphraseCode**.

![](../assets/PassphraseCode.png)

```cs
var passphraseCode = new BitcoinPassphraseCode("my secret", Network.Main, null);
```

**You then give this passphraseCode to a third party key generator.**

The third party will then generate new encrypted keys for you.

![](../assets/PassphraseCodeToEncryptedKeys.png)

```cs
EncryptedKeyResult encryptedKeyResult = passphraseCode.GenerateEncryptedSecret();
```

This **EncryptedKeyResult** have lots of information:

![](../assets/EncryptedKeyResult.png)

First: the **generated bitcoin address**,

```cs
var generatedAddress = encryptedKeyResult.GeneratedAddress; // 14KZsAVLwafhttaykXxCZt95HqadPXuz73
```

then the **EncryptedKey** itself, \(as we have seen in the previous, **Key Encryption** lesson\),

```cs
var encryptedKey = encryptedKeyResult.EncryptedKey; // 6PnWtBokjVKMjuSQit1h1Ph6rLMSFz2n4u3bjPJH1JMcp1WHqVSfr5ebNS
```

and last but not the least, the **ConfirmationCode**, so that the third party can prove that the generated key and address correspond effectively to your password.

```cs
var confirmationCode = encryptedKeyResult.ConfirmationCode; // cfrm38VUcrdt2zf1dCgf4e8gPNJJxnhJSdxYg6STRAEs7QuAuLJmT5W7uNqj88hzh9bBnU9GFkN
```

As the owner, once you receive these info, you need to check that the key generator did not cheat by using **ConfirmationCode.Check**, then get your private key with your password:

```cs
Console.WriteLine(confirmationCode.Check("my secret", generatedAddress)); // True
var bitcoinPrivateKey = encryptedKey.GetSecret("my secret");
Console.WriteLine(bitcoinPrivateKey.GetAddress() == generatedAddress); // True
Console.WriteLine(bitcoinPrivateKey); // KzzHhrkr39a7upeqHzYNNeJuaf1SVDBpxdFDuMvFKbFhcBytDF1R
```

So, we have just seen how the third party can generate encrypted key on your behalf, without knowing your password and private key.

![](../assets/ThirdPartyKeyGeneration.png)

However, one problem remains:

* All backup of your wallet that you have will become outdated when you generate a new key.

BIP 32, or Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets \(HD wallets\) proposes another solution, and is more widely supported.

## HD Wallet \(BIP 32\) {#hd-wallet-bip-32}

Let’s keep in mind the problems that we want to resolve:

* Prevent outdated backups
* Delegating key \/ address generation to an untrusted peer

A “Deterministic” wallet would fix our backup problem. With such wallet, you would have to save only the seed. From this seed, you can generate the same series of private key over and over.

This is what the “Deterministic” stands for.  
As you can see, from the master key, I can generate new keys:

```cs
ExtKey masterKey = new ExtKey();
Console.WriteLine("Master key : " + masterKey.ToString(Network.Main));
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    ExtKey key = masterKey.Derive((uint)i);
    Console.WriteLine("Key " + i + " : " + key.ToString(Network.Main));
}
```

```
Master key : xprv9s21ZrQH143K3JneCAiVkz46BsJ4jUdH8C16DccAgMVfy2yY5L8A4XqTvZqCiKXhNWFZXdLH6VbsCsqBFsSXahfnLajiB6ir46RxgdkNsFk

```

You only need to save the **masterKey**, since you can generate the same suite of private keys over and over.

As you can see, these keys are **ExtKey** and not **Key** as you are used to. However, this should not stop you since you have the real private key inside:

![](../assets/ExtKey.png)

You can go back from a **Key** to an **ExtKey** by supplying the **Key** and the **ChainCode** to the **ExtKey** constructor. This works as follows:

```cs
ExtKey extKey = new ExtKey();
byte[] chainCode = extKey.ChainCode;
Key key = extKey.PrivateKey;

ExtKey newExtKey = new ExtKey(key, chainCode);
```

The **base58** type equivalent of **ExtKey** is called **BitcoinExtKey**.

But how can we solve our second problem: delegating address creation to a peer that can potentially be hacked \(like a payment server\)?

The trick is that you can “neuter” your master key, then you have a public \(without private key\) version of the master key. From this neutered version, a third party can generate public keys without knowing the private key.

```cs
ExtPubKey masterPubKey = masterKey.Neuter();
for (int i = 0 ; i < 5 ; i++)
{
    ExtPubKey pubkey = masterPubKey.Derive((uint)i);
    Console.WriteLine("PubKey " + i + " : " + pubkey.ToString(Network.Main));
}
```

\`\`\`PubKey 0 : xpub67uQd5a6WCY6A7NZfi7yGoGLwXCTX5R7QQfMag8z1RMGoX1skbXAeB9JtkaTiDoeZPprGH1drvgYcviXKppXtEGSVwmmx4pAdisKv2CqoWS

PubKey 3 : xpub67uQd5a6WCY6HQKya2Mwwb7bpSNB5XhWCR76kRaPxchE3Y1Y2MAiSjhRGftmeWyX8cJ3kL7LisJ3s4hHDWvhw3DWpEtkihPpofP3dAngh5M

    So imagine that your payment server generate pubkey1, you can get the corresponding private key with your private master key.

    ```cs
    masterKey = new ExtKey();
    masterPubKey = masterKey.Neuter();

    //The payment server generate pubkey1
    ExtPubKey pubkey1 = masterPubKey.Derive((uint)1);

    //You get the private key of pubkey1
    ExtKey key1 = masterKey.Derive((uint)1);

    //Check it is legit
    Console.WriteLine("Generated address : " + pubkey1.PubKey.GetAddress(Network.Main));
    Console.WriteLine("Expected address : " + key1.PrivateKey.PubKey.GetAddress(Network.Main));

```
Generated address : 1Jy8nALZNqpf4rFN9TWG2qXapZUBvquFfX
Expected address : 1Jy8nALZNqpf4rFN9TWG2qXapZUBvquFfX
```

**ExtPubKey** is similar to **ExtKey** except that it holds a **PubKey** and not a **Key**.

![](../assets/ExtPubKey.png)

Now we have seen how Deterministic keys solve our problems, let’s speak about what the “hierarchical” is for.

In the previous exercise, we have seen that by combining master key + index we could generate another key. We call this process **Derivation**, master key is the **parent key**, and the generated key is called **child key**.

However, you can also derivate children from the child key. This is what the “hierarchical” stands for.

This is why conceptually more generally you can say: Parent Key + KeyPath =&gt; Child Key

![](../assets/Derive1.png)

![](../assets/Derive2.png)

In this diagram, you can derivate Child\(1,1\) from parent in two different way:

```cs
ExtKey parent = new ExtKey();
ExtKey child11 = parent.Derive(1).Derive(1);
```

Or

```cs
ExtKey parent = new ExtKey();
ExtKey child11 = parent.Derive(new KeyPath("1/1"));
```

So in summary:

![](../assets/DeriveKeyPath.png)

It works the same for **ExtPubKey**.

Why do you need hierarchical keys? Because it might be a nice way to classify the type of your keys for multi account purpose. More on [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki).

It also permit to segment account rights across an organization.

Imagine you are CEO of a company. You want control over all wallet, but you don’t want that the Accounting department spend the money of the Marketing department.

So your first idea would be to generate one hierarchy for each department.

![](../assets/CeoMarketingAccounting.png)

However, in such case, **Accounting** and **Marketing** would be able to recover the CEO’s private key.

We define such child keys as **non-hardened**.

![](../assets/NonHardened.png)

```cs
ExtKey ceoKey = new ExtKey();
Console.WriteLine("CEO: " + ceoKey.ToString(Network.Main));
ExtKey accountingKey = ceoKey.Derive(0, hardened: false);

ExtPubKey ceoPubkey = ceoKey.Neuter();

//Recover ceo key with accounting private key and ceo public key
ExtKey ceoKeyRecovered = accountingKey.GetParentExtKey(ceoPubkey);
Console.WriteLine("CEO recovered: " + ceoKeyRecovered.ToString(Network.Main));
```

```
CEO: xprv9s21ZrQH143K2XcJU89thgkBehaMqvcj4A6JFxwPs6ZzGYHYT8dTchd87TC4NHSwvDuexuFVFpYaAt3gztYtZyXmy2hCVyVyxumdxfDBpoC
CEO recovered: xprv9s21ZrQH143K2XcJU89thgkBehaMqvcj4A6JFxwPs6ZzGYHYT8dTchd87TC4NHSwvDuexuFVFpYaAt3gztYtZyXmy2hCVyVyxumdxfDBpoC
```

In other words, a **non-hardened key** can “climb” the hierarchy.**Non-hardened key** should only be used for categorizing accounts that belongs to a **single control**.

So in our case, the CEO should create a **hardened key**, so the accounting department will not be able to climb.

```cs
ExtKey ceoKey = new ExtKey();
Console.WriteLine("CEO: " + ceoKey.ToString(Network.Main));
ExtKey accountingKey = ceoKey.Derive(0, hardened: true);

ExtPubKey ceoPubkey = ceoKey.Neuter();

ExtKey ceoKeyRecovered = accountingKey.GetParentExtKey(ceoPubkey); //Crash
```

You can also create hardened key by via the **ExtKey.Derivate**\(**KeyPath\)**, by using an apostrophe after a child’s index:

```cs
var nonHardened = new KeyPath("1/2/3");
var hardened = new KeyPath("1/2/3'");
```

So let’s imagine that the Accounting Department generate 1 parent key for each customer, and a child for each of the customer’s payment.

As the CEO, you want to spend the money on one of these addresses. Here is how you would proceed.

```cs
ceoKey = new ExtKey();
string accounting = "1'";
int customerId = 5;
int paymentId = 50;
KeyPath path = new KeyPath(accounting + "/" + customerId + "/" + paymentId);
//Path : "1'/5/50"
ExtKey paymentKey = ceoKey.Derive(path);
```

## Mnemonic Code for HD Keys \(BIP39\) {#mnemonic-code-for-hd-keys-bip39}

As you have seen, generating an HD keys is easy. However, what if we want as easy way to transmit such key by telephone or hand writing?

Cold wallets like Trezor, generates the HD Keys from a sentence that can easily be written down. They call such sentence “the seed” or “mnemonic”. And it can eventually be protected by a password or a PIN.  
![](../assets/Trezor.png)

The language that you use to generate your easy to write sentence is called a **Wordlist**

![](../assets/RootKey.png)

```cs
Mnemonic mnemo = new Mnemonic(Wordlist.English, WordCount.Twelve);
ExtKey hdRoot = mnemo.DeriveExtKey("my password");
Console.WriteLine(mnemo);
```

`minute put grant neglect anxiety case globe win famous correct turn link`

Now, if you have the mnemonic and the password, you can recover the **hdRoot** key.

```cs
mnemo = new Mnemonic("minute put grant neglect anxiety case globe win famous correct turn link",
                Wordlist.English);
hdRoot = mnemo.DeriveExtKey("my password");
```

Currently supported **wordlist** are, English, Japanese, Spanish, Chinese \(simplified and traditional\).

## Dark Wallet {#dark-wallet}

This name is unfortunate since there is nothing dark about it, and it attract unwanted attention and worries.Dark Wallet is a practical solution that fix our two initial problems:

* Prevent outdated backups
* Delegating key \/ address generation to an untrusted peer

But it has a bonus killer feature.

You have to share only one address with the world \(called **StealthAddress**\), without leaking any privacy.

Let’s remind us that if you share one **BitcoinAddress** with everybody, then all can see your balance by consulting the blockchain… That’s not the case with a **StealthAddress**.

This is a real shame it was labeled as **dark** since it solves partially the important problem of privacy leaking caused by the pseudo-anonymity of Bitcoin. A better name would have been: **One Address**.

In Dark Wallet terminology, here are the different actors:

* The **Payer** knows the **StealthAddress** of the **Receiver**
* The **Receiver** knows the **Spend Key**, a secret that will allow him to spend the coins he receives from one of such transaction.
* **Scanner** knows the **Scan Key**, a secret that allows him to detect the transactions those belong to the **Receiver**.

The rest is operational details.Underneath, this **StealthAddress** is composed of one or several **Spend PubKey** \(for multi sig\), and one **Scan PubKey**.

![](../assets/StealthAddress.png)

```cs
var scanKey = new Key();
var spendKey = new Key();
BitcoinStealthAddress stealthAddress
    = new BitcoinStealthAddress
        (
        scanKey: scanKey.PubKey,
        pubKeys: new[] { spendKey.PubKey },
        signatureCount: 1,
        bitfield: null,
        network: Network.Main);
```

The **payer**, will take your **StealthAddress**, generate a temporary key called **Ephem Key** and will generate a **Stealth Pub Key**, from which the Bitcoin address to which the payment will be done is generated.

![](../assets/EphemKey.png)

Then, he will package the **Ephem PubKey** in a **Stealth Metadata** object embedded that in the OP\_RETURN of the transaction \(as we have done for the first challenge\)

He will also add the output to the generated bitcoin address. \(the address of the **Stealth pub key**\)

![](../assets/StealthMetadata.png)

```cs
var ephemKey = new Key();
Transaction transaction = new Transaction();
stealthAddress.SendTo(transaction, Money.Coins(1.0m), ephemKey);
Console.WriteLine(transaction);
```

The creation of the **EphemKey** being an implementation details, you can omit it, NBitcoin will generate one automatically:

```cs
Transaction transaction = new Transaction();
stealthAddress.SendTo(transaction, Money.Coins(1.0m));
Console.WriteLine(transaction);
```

```json
{
  "hash": "7772b0ad19acd1bd2b0330238a898fe021486315bd1e15f4154cd3931a4940f9",
  "ver": 1,
  "vin_sz": 0,
  "vout_sz": 2,
  "lock_time": 0,
  "size": 93,
  "in": [],
  "out": [
    {
      "value": "0.00000000",
      "scriptPubKey": "OP_RETURN 060000000002b9266f15e8c6598e7f25d3262969a774df32b9b0b50fea44fc8d914c68176f3e"
    },
    {
      "value": "1.00000000",
      "scriptPubKey": "OP_DUP OP_HASH16051f68af989f5bf24259c519829f46c7f2935b756 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then the payer add and signs the inputs, then sends the transaction on the network.

The **Scanner** knowing the **StealthAddress** and the **Scan Key** can recover the **Stealth PubKey** and so expected **BitcoinAddress** payment.

![](../assets/ScannerRecover.png)

Then the scanner checks if one of the output of the transaction correspond to such address. If it is, then **Scanner** notify the **Receiver** about the transaction.

The **Receiver** can then get the private key of the address with his **Spend Key**.

![](../assets/ReceiverStealth.png)

The code explaining how, as a Scanner, to scan a transaction and how, as a Receiver, to uncover the private key, will be explained later in the **TransactionBuilder** \(Other types of ownership\) part.

It should be noted that a **StealthAddress** can have multiple **spend pubkeys**, in which case, the address represent a multi sig.

One limit of Dark Wallet is the use of **OP\_RETURN**, so we can’t easily embed arbitrary data in the transaction as we have done for in Bitcoin Transfer. \(Current bitcoin rules allows only one OP\_RETURN of 40 bytes, soon 80, per transaction\)

> \([Stackoverflow](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/29648/26859)\) As I understand it, the "stealth address" is intended to address a very specific problem. If you wish to solicit payments from the public, say by posting a donation address on your website, then everyone can see on the block chain that all those payments went to you, and perhaps try to track how you spend them.
> 
> With a stealth address, you ask payers to generate a unique address in such a way that you \(using some additional data which is attached to the transaction\) can deduce the corresponding private key. So although you publish a single "stealth address" on your website, the block chain sees all your incoming payments as going to separate addresses and has no way to correlate them. \(Of course, any individual payer knows their payment went to you, and can trace how you spend it, but they don't learn anything about other people's payments to you.\)
> 
> But you can get the same effect another way: just give each payer a unique address. Rather than posting a single public donation address on your website, have a button that generates a new unique address and saves the private key, or selects the next address from a long list of pre-generated addresses \(whose private keys you hold somewhere safe\). Just as before, the payments all go to separate addresses and there is no way to correlate them, nor for one payer to see that other payments went to you.
> 
> So the only difference with stealth addresses is essentially to move the chore of producing a unique address from the server to the client. Indeed, in some ways stealth addresses may be worse, since very few people use them, and if you are known to be one of them, it will be easier to connect stealth transactions with you.
> 
> It doesn't provide "100% anonymity". The fundamental anonymity weakness of Bitcoin remains - that everyone can follow the chain of payments, and if you know something about one transaction or the parties to it, you can deduce something about where those coins came from or where they went.
