## Bitcoin address {#bitcoin-address}

You know that your **Bitcoin Address** is what you share to the world to get paid.  
![](../assets/BitcoinAddress.png)  
You probably know that your wallet software uses a **private key** to spend the money you received on this address.
![](../assets/PrivateKey.png)  

The keys are not stored on the network and they can be generated without access to the Internet.  

This is how you generate a private key with NBitcoin:  
```cs  
// Generate a random private key.
Key keyObj = new Key(); 
```  
From the private key, we use a one-way cryptographic function, to generate a **public key**. 

![](../assets/PrivKeyPubKey.png)  
```cs 
PubKey publicKey = privateKey.PubKey;
Console.WriteLine(publicKey); 
//Output:
//0251036303164f6c458e9f7abecb4e55e5ce9ec2b2f1d06d633c9653a07976560c
```

## Bitcoin network and Bitcoin address {#bitcoin-network-and-bitcoin-address}
There are two Bitcoin **networks**: 
* **TestNet** is a Bitcoin network for development purposes. Bitcoins on this network worth nothing.  
* **MainNet** is the Bitcoin network everybody uses.  

> **Note:** You can acquire testnet coins quickly by using **faucets**. Just google "get testnet bitcoins".  

You can easily get your **bitcoin address** from your public key and the **network** on which this address should be used. 

![](../assets/PubKeyToAddr.png)  

```cs 
Console.WriteLine(publicKey.GetAddress(Network.Main)); 
//Output:
//1PUYsjwfNmX64wS368ZR5FMouTtUmvtmTY
Console.WriteLine(publicKey.GetAddress(Network.TestNet)); 
//Output:
//n3zWAo2eBnxLr3ueohXnuAa8mTVBhxmPhq
```  
Note that a bitcoin address for mainnet starts with "1", and a bitcoin address for testnet starts with "m" or "n".

**To be precise, a bitcoin address is made up of a "version byte" which is different on both networks(mainnet, testnet). But this version byte identifies the network type. And a bitcoin address is also made of your "public keyâ€™s hash bytes". Both of these bytes are concatenated and then encoded into a Base58Check encoding scheme which has an additional 4 bytes checksum data, compared to a Base58:**  

In other words, it means that a generated bitcoin address is always in Base58Check encoding scheme.(If this is wrong, please edit it.)

The above illustration shows a standard way of generating a bitcoin address by processing entire steps(Public key -> Public key hash + Network => Bitcoin address), with not using a sugar syntax for generating a bitcoin address(Public key + Network => Bitcoin address).

```cs 
var publicKeyHash = publicKey.Hash;
Console.WriteLine(publicKeyHash);
//Output:
//f6889b21b5540353a29ed18c45ea0031280c42cf

//Get a bitcoin address for a mainnet by publicKeyHash and network identifier.
var mainNetAddress = publicKeyHash.GetAddress(Network.Main);
var testNetAddress = publicKeyHash.GetAddress(Network.TestNet);

Console.WriteLine(mainNetAddress); 
//Output:
//1PUYsjwfNmX64wS368ZR5FMouTtUmvtmTY
Console.WriteLine(testNetAddress); 
//Output:
//n3zWAo2eBnxLr3ueohXnuAa8mTVBhxmPhq
```  

> **Fact:** Internally, a **public key hash** is generated by using a SHA256 cryptographic hash function on the public key, then a RIPEMD160 cryptographic hash function on the result, using Big Endian notation. The function could look like this: RIPEMD160(SHA256(publickey))  

## Encoding schemes {# encoding-schemes}
There is a one binary-to-text encoding scheme which is called Base64.
Base64 represents binary data in an ASCII string format with 64 characters composed of A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and +(plus) ,/(slash).

Base58 is a modification of Base64 which was first suggested by Satoshi Nakamoto for Bitcoin system implementation.
Base58 uses 58 characters by eleminating 6 characters from Base64 such as 0(zero), O(uppercase o), I(uppercase i), l(lowercase L), +(plus), and /(slash) to avoid a mistake by an ambiguity of characters.

The Base58Check, a modification of Base58, encoding scheme has some neat features, such as checksums to prevent typos aside from a lack of ambiguous characters such as '0' and 'O' from Base58.  
The Base58Check encoding scheme also provides a consistent way to determine the network of a given address, which means that this feature prevents a wallet from sending MainNet coins to a TestNet address.

```cs
var bitcoinAddressForMainNet = keyObj.PubKey.GetAddress(Network.MainNet);
var bitcoinAddressForTestNet = keyObj.PubKey.GetAddress(Network.TestNet);

//Get the consistent network type from the specific Bitcoin address.
var mainNetFromBitcoinAddress = bitcoinAddressForMainNet.Network;
var testNetFromBitcoinAddress = bitcoinAddressForTestNet.Network;
```

> **Tip:** Practicing a Bitcoin Programming on MainNet makes mistakes more memorable.
