## Pre-requisites {#pre-requisites}

### Skills {#skills}

*   You need to be comfortable with object oriented as well as functional programming.
*   A basic grasp of C# is helpful, but we feel the code will be legible to Java and other C-based languages.
*   No mathematic knowledge is required. We will not cover cryptography beyond the bare minimum that you need to know to make a secure service.
*   You don’t need to have deep knowledge of Bitcoin.

### Tools {#tools}

*   [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/) on Windows or [Xamarin Studio](https://store.xamarin.com) on Mac and Linux. (Both free)
*   [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/) - Ideally you have it, but you can just proceed without it.

> **Tip:** If disk-space is an issue, consider running Bitcoin Core in pruning mode. It is practically the same as a full node (including security), except it throws away some of the old history.
